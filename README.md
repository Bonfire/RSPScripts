# RSPeer Scripts
A collection of my RSPeer Scripts

## Script Contents:
* bonScouter - A script that scouts a specific area and hops worlds, calling out any people that have specific items. Has the ability to send Discord Webhooks for clan callouts.
* bonBeefCooker - A script that runs to the Lumbridge cow pen, picks up raw beef, runs to the Lumbridge range, and cooks the beef for easy cooking XP. 
* bonGUIDesign - A script to test various GUI elements for my other scripts. Does not have any functionality.
* bonCooksAssistant **(Unfinished)** - A script that will complete the Cook's Assistant quest from start to finish. **Note that this was a test to use tasks in a questing script. I would not recommend writing questing scripts this way.**
* bonRaidScouter **(Unfinished)** - A script that will scout Chambers of Xeric raids. Actual room and layout solving not implemented (yet).
